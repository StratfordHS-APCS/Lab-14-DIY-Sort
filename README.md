# Lab 14 - DIY Sort

### Instructions ###

For this lab you will be making your own sorting algorithm.  The only requrements are that an `ArrayList<Integer>` that is passed to `mySort` will be sorted after `mySort` is complete, and that you include a description of how your algorithm works as a comment in `Main.java`.  The `ArrayList` to be sorted will have at least 1 item in it.

### Testing ###

Create various `ArrayList`s in `main` and make sure your code works.  If you want to run the tests before committing and pushing to GitHub follow the following steps.

1. Ctrl-Shift-S to get a shell window.
2. In the shell window enter `mvn test` to run the tests.
